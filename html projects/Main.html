          <h1>OHRID - the Balkan's Pearl</h1>
          <p>Sublime Ohrid is North Macedonia's most seductive destination. It sits on the edge of serene Lake Ohrid, with an atmospheric old quarter that cascades down steep streets, dotted with beautiful churches and topped by the bones of a medieval castle. Traditional restaurants and lakeside cafes liven up the cobblestone streets, which in high summer can be very lively indeed.

        <p1>The archeological remains on the hill above the Ohrid Lake tell us of life in continuity of 3 milleniums. The historical sources speak of this region in Arhaic past and 5 century BC was controlled by the powerful Brigi
            tribe that had their own town on the south and east meadows of the hill above the Lake. On this same area in the 5 century BC the artefacts show the existence of rich family of Engelani (necropolis today Upper Gate
            golden mask and other golden things and armour) They were predecessors to Lihnid people and in 4 century BC the town is known as Lihnid-the city of light. The town got todays' urbanized look during the time of the
            Macedonian Kingdom and we can see that from the fortified acropolis on the top of the hill and the octagonal street net with civil objects by them (antique theatre).  In the Roman times Lihnid played an important
            role on the Via Egnatia road that connected Durres and Thessaloniki. In the period the population grew and the town spreaded. By coming of Christianity and the arriving of the first Christian misioneries the town
            becomes a very important centre of Christianity.<br>In the following centuries many early- christian churches are built and Lihnid is mentioned as an influential Episcopal centre. During the Great moving of the
            nations this town was very often a target to the Huns and Go invaders. The natural disaster that happened in 526 on 30th of May started the destruction of Lihnid and its continuing disappearance of historical evidence.
            The earthquake and the spread of contagious diseases, frequent robberies from the Avar tribes made closure of one period of the town's history-the ancient times. However life still goes on but with new people-Slavs
            and towns became bridge that connected Byza and the South Slavs.</p1>
