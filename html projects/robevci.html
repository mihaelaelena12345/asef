                    <p>The Robevi House is a famous and historic building in Ohrid, North Macedonia. It was built in its current state in 1863â€“1864 by Todor Petkov from a village Gari near Debar. Just above that small cobbled street are the beautiful houses of the famous Ohrid's merchant families such as: Bodlevi, Kackov, Robev, Savinov, Sapundjiev, Krapchev which show monuments of the Ohrid's town architecture from the middle of the 19th century. They share white facades, many windows and wooden terraces. This architecture was admired by Le Corbusier himself, the father of the modern architecture. Today the houses of the Robev and Uzunche family are turned into museums with priceless artefacts. The Macedonian Academy of Science and Art was formed in the house of Urania. The houses which are built so tight one to another form shades that allow walk and strolling in the summer heats.
